1. Experiment with escdata regex and be sure you can correctly use its various features.
Draft tests to validate your understanding of the tool and be prepared to discuss them.

a. What was the most useful feature of the tool?

b. What was the biggest hurdle to using the tool?




2. What is the difference between the test and test-batch feature of escdata regex?




3. What flags are available in the Java dialect? How do they affect the regular expression?




4. Recall the example in which we considered 10-digit student IDs that could not repeat any

a. What was the returned capture group when using the JavaScript dialect (https://regex101.com/)?

b. What is the returned capture group when using the Java dialect (escdata regex).
