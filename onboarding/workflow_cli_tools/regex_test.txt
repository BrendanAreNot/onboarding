1. Experiment with escdata regex and be sure you can correctly use its various features.
Draft tests to validate your understanding of the tool and be prepared to discuss them.

a. What was the most useful feature of the tool?

Being able to export a set of results to another csv is very useful. Additionally, having the ability to run multiple regexes at once over multiple files, with replacements is very useful as well.


b. What was the biggest hurdle to using the tool?

Having to escape so many characters when using escdata regex test can be frustrating. I'm not yet used to having to escape every backslash with another backslash, but the parentheses tripped me up too. Thankfully, using escdata regex test-batch allows the files to be run without escaping characters.


2. What is the difference between the test and test-batch feature of escdata regex?

escdata regex test will take one regular expression and one file to test it on. It can then produce a csv of the results. escdata regex test-batch uses a file containing multiple test instructions and runs them together. It can also export these results and each regex-file pair gets its own csv. The "batch" is a collection of regex-file pairs.


3. What flags are available in the Java dialect? How do they affect the regular expression?

Some of the most common flags, and their effects, are:
(?i) - the regex is now case-insensitive
(?s) - the wildcard character (.) now matches newlines
(?m) - ^ and $ now match at line breaks
(?x) - the regex now ignores whitespace


4. Recall the example in which we considered 10-digit student IDs that could not repeat any
digit 3 times in a row. The regex was: ^(?:(\d)(?!\1{2})){10}$.

a. What was the returned capture group when using the JavaScript dialect (https://regex101.com/)?

The returned capture group for a successful match was the final digit of the match.
For example, 1234567890 had 0 as the final capture group.

b. What is the returned capture group when using the Java dialect (escdata regex).
How did you test this?

A successful match using escdata regex returns the final digit that was captured, just like the Regex101 example. I tested this by replacing the successful groups with --$1-- (escaped to --\$1-- when using escdata regex test).
For example, 0985681231 returned "--1--".
