1. What methods are available that add emphasis to text? What are the conventions?

Emphasis can be added as italics, bold, bold italics, or monospace font.
*italics* or _italics_
**bold** or __bold__
***bold italics*** or ___bold italics___
`monospace font`
Monospace font and bold/italics can be combined as well.


2. What is the longest any line should be in an ESCMarkdown file? How do you emphasize content that must be written over multiple lines?

The longest any line can be in ESCMarkdown is 80. Content that must be written over multiple lines can be bolded or italicized from the start of the line to the end of the line. Anything seperated by a blank line will have to be emphasized in segments.



3. What are the available section delimiters? Which should be used per the conventions? If
using atx notation as a section delimiter, how long should the delimiter be?

There are two types of notation for section delimiters, Setext and atx notation. Setext starts denotes sections using the # symbol. More #s means further nesting. atx notation uses ===, ---, or ... followed by a blank line to denote new sections.

For example:
# Section 1
## Section 2 
### Section 3
In this example, Section 3 is nested in Section 2, which is nested in Section 1.

Using atx notion:
Section 1
========

Section 2
---

Section 3
...............................
Once again, Section 3 is nested in Section 2, which is nested in Section 1.
The length of the ===, ---, or ... has to be 3 or greater.


4. What does it mean to (not) externalize a table?

An externalized table is not printed within the document itself. It is printed to an "external" file such as a CSV or Excel file. Tables without unique column names are never externalized. Whether a table is externalized or not is determined by adding "EXTERNALIZE" or "NO-EXTERNALIZE" as the last item in the table's title line.


5. What are the conventions for adding list items? How should sublists be included?

List items can be added using either a hyphen (-), an asterisk (*), or a plus (+) in the same style as bullet points for any other list. Using numbers followed by a period (1.) will start a numbered list. Numbered lists are automatically counted by the system, so the actual order of the numbers doesn't matter. Just the fact that it is a number followed by a period is enough. This makes it easy to add entries inbetween entries without having the re-number the list. Sublists can be created using indentation, just like Word. It is worth noting that two separate lists need to be split by two blank lines.


6. What must you write in ESCMarkdown to print ’$’?

The dollar sign ($) must be escaped using a backslash. \$ would print a dollar sign.


7. What is the syntax for inserting a block quote? What other block-like features are available?

A block quote can be inserted using two lines of triple backticks.
For example:
```
the text in here
is part of the verbatim block!
```
Tables can also be considered a block-like feature since each entry is treated as a block of data.


8. What document types are available? How do you specify which is used?

The three available document types are article, book, and memo(texMemo). Memos tend to be shorter than articles which are shorter than books. This is important for transcribers which may use different formating depending on the document type. The document type is specified by the characters surrounding the document's title, author and date. Articles surround the info in one line of equal signs (===). Books use two consecutive sets of equals signs and then an additional line at the bottom of the header. Memos use dashed lines (---).


9. Draft a simple memo demonstrating everything that you’ve learned about ESCMarkdown. It
need not (and should not) simply be regurgitation of the documentation. Print it to both PDF
and HTML using the escdocument tool. Copy your memo to the correct directory that will
allow you to access it within your podman container and convert.
