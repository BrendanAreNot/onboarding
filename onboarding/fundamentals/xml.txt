1.3 - XML Exercises

1. Is the example below a ’well formed’ XML document? If not, make the corrections needed.

OLD:
<?xml version=1.0>
<to>Candidate</to>
<from>Onboarding</from>
<body>XML is fun!</body>

REVISED:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<message>
	<to>Candidate</to>
	<from>Onboarding</from>
	<body>XML is fun!</body>
</message>

CHANGES MADE:
	- Added a Root Element <message>
	- Quotes added to the version number in the prolog
	- Added a '?' to the end of the prolog

In a 'well formed' XML document:
	- There must be a root element (in this case <message>)
	- Elements need a closing tag (<body> needs </body>, for example)
	- Tags must match (they're case sensative)
	- Elements must be properly nested (think about it like parentheses)
		- <A><B><C>Text<C><B><A> is correct
		- <A><B><C>Text<A><B><C> is incorrect
	- Attribute values must be quoted (usually following an '=', such as version="1.0")


2. How can you get the XML parser to ignore a section of your XML file and treat it as a block
of character data?

The CDATA section can be used to treat everything within as textual, non-marked-up content.
For example,
	<![CDATA[Spinach < Ice Cream]]> is read as "Spinach < Ice Cream", despite "<" being a predefined entity
	<![CDATA[<to>Candidate</to>]]> would be interpreted literally as "<to>Candidate</to>"
	In <to>Candidate</to>, the 'to's are interpreted as markup and only "Candidte" remains


3. What are the reserved characters in XML, and how can you escape them?

Reserved characters can be escaped by using a code contained within & and ;.
Reserved characters and their escape sequences include the following:
	- < (less than) - &lt;
	- > (greater than) - &gt;
	- & (ampersand) - &amp;
	- ' (apostrophe) - &apos;
	- " (quotation) - &quot;



4. What is the correct syntax for declaring the version of an XML document?

The correct syntax is <?xml version="1.0"?>


5. How do you insert single-line comments into an XML document? Multi-line comments?

Single line comments can be done using <!-- Comment goes here -->
A Multi-line comment can be done in the same way, just over multiple lines
<!-- 
Comment
goes
here
or
here
or
even
here! 
-->
